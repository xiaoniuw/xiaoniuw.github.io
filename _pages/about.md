I am a first-year Master's student at the Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yazhen Qin, a leading expert in laboratory hematology and molecular diagnostics.

Under Prof. Qin's mentorship, my research focuses on the molecular mechanisms of hematological malignancies and their clinical applications. Prof. Qin's group primarily investigates:

Molecular targeted therapy resistance mechanisms in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring using advanced molecular technologies

Clinical validation of novel molecular biomarkers for leukemia diagnosis and prognosis

Standardization and quality control of molecular diagnostics in hematology

ðŸ”¬ My Research Interests:

Mechanisms of drug resistance in FLT3-ITD mutated AML

Development of standardized MRD detection protocols

Application of next-generation sequencing in clinical hematology

Translation of molecular findings to clinical practice

ðŸ“š Education:

M.M. in Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital (2025-present)

ðŸŽ¯ Technical Expertise:

Molecular techniques: RT-PCR, Digital PCR, Next-generation sequencing

Cellular assays: Cell culture, Drug sensitivity testing, Apoptosis analysis

Bioinformatics: R, Python, Linux command line

Clinical data analysis and interpretation
